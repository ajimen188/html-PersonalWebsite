					<h3> Stocks and Etfs </h3>
					<p> I have started investing a portion of my money in the stock market. I have researched different types of stocks and ETFs and purchased
						the ones that I believe will benefit my portfolio in the long run. Currently, my portfolio is focused on the technology and financial
						sectors, but I plan to diversify it in the future.</p>

					<h3>Boxing</h3>
					<p> In my freshman year of high school, I got into a disagreement with one of my classmates, which escalated into a physical fight. 
						Unfortunately, I ended up getting seriously injured. Following that incident, I found a boxing gym and began training there. I trained
						 in boxing for approximately two years, dedicating myself to learning as much as possible, and eventually became a skilled and well-trained
						  fighter.</p>
